WordNet Domains

This repository contains a copy of WordNet Domains 3.2 as distributed by the
Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK). Apart from the addition of this file,
``README.rst``, it is entirely unmodified.

I (Lars Buitinck) am not affiliated with FBK or the WordNet Domains project in
any way. I just set up this tarball to save others from having to go through
the slow FBK download form.
